    The fetch() method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch. It returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request, whether it is successful or not.
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch
    The Promise returned from fetch() wonâ€™t reject on HTTP error status even if the response is an HTTP 404 or 500. Instead, it will resolve normally (with ok status set to false), and it will only reject on network failure or if anything prevented the request from completing.
